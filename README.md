# Introduction

A modern real estate web application using MERN stack. Created to challenge myself creating a full stack application.

# Setup

You need to setup the configuration for the backend. Create a new file called `.env` on the root of this project. And set the value inside the file!

```
DB_URI = "[MONGO_DB_URI]"
```
